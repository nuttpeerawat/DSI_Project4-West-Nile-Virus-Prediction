# DSI_Project4-West-Nile-Virus-Prediction
-----------------------------------------

# Problem Statement

West Nile Virus has effect on economic in Chicago. So, we will try to predicting WNV And prevent it to maximize cost benefit for USA government. Furthermore, we will specify the factor which impact the WNV the most and when to spray in Chicago.

# Executive Summary

West Nile virus is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitos. Around 20% of people who become infected with the virus develop symptoms ranging from a persistent fever, to serious neurological illnesses that can result in death.

In 2002, the first human cases of West Nile virus were reported in Chicago. By 2004 the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) had established a comprehensive surveillance and control program that is still in effect today.

With the problem statement we will try to predict which trap the WNV will present therefore, we can preventing by spray the pesticide to save the economic costs and also do some cost-benefit analysis

# Conclusions 

Our model correctly predicts 78.2% of the observations

Among posts that our model predicted, Sensitivity 92% (False Negative 155 which is have WNV but predicted not have WNV)
Conclusion

WNV is highly seasonal, most occur in July and August (week21-week32)
WNV outbreak are more serious in summer (high temperature) and high perciption (humidity, dewpoint, etc.)
Therefore, we need to spray before week 31 to maximize cost benefit.
Scope for future improvements:

Go deep down in weather: streaks of weather like rain 7 days in a row
Spatial area correlation is neighbor area effect.
Spatial time series correlation is neighbor temperature effect or not.
